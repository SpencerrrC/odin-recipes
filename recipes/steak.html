        <p>Set the oven to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Though I'm going off memory, so you'll have to forgive me if this is way too high. To test the heat, stick your head in the oven to check it's hot enough.(Note, I am not responsible for any injuries caused by this. Do it at your own risk, and make sure to educate yourself properly before doing anything.)</p>

        <p>Take out the pan(with a cloth to not burn you) and set the flame on high. Start searin' and clearin', until there's a nice brown crust on all sides.</p>

        <p>Put in your butter, enough so that when it's melted there's at least 1.5 spoonfuls of liquid remaining. Then throw in the garlic and other herbs. Tilt the pan away from you, then scoop the melted butter herb mix onto the top of your steak constantly for about 3-5 minutes.</p>

    <p><h2>
        <ol start="5"><li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
